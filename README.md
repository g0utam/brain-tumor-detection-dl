# Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning ðŸ§ ðŸ©º

This project leverages **Transfer Learning** with the **VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to detect brain tumors in MRI scans. The model classifies MRI images into tumor and non-tumor categories using image classification techniques with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
